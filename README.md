# Username Validation App

## Overview
This project is a Python-based username validation application. It checks whether a username conforms to a set of predefined rules that aim to ensure security and usability. The program is designed to educate beginners on how to use Python for input validation with the help of regular expressions.

## Validation Rules
The username must meet the following conditions to be considered valid:
1. The username must be between 5 and 15 characters in length.
2. The username must contain only alphanumeric characters and symbols.
3. The username must start with a letter.
4. The username must contain at least one uppercase letter.
5. The username must contain at least one symbol or special character.

## Usage
You can use this program to validate usernames either by running the script directly or incorporating it into another project. The program will output whether the entered username is valid or provide a specific reason why the username is invalid.

## Running the Application
1. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x is recommended).
2. Run the script from the command line or an IDE.
3. Enter a username when prompted, and the program will return whether the username is valid or why it is invalid.
